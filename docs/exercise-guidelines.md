# MamaStrength Exercise Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines the principles and guidelines we follow when designing exercises for MamaStrength. Our approach integrates physical recovery and strength building with the nurturing of the mother-baby relationship. These guidelines ensure all exercises align with our mission to support mothers' physical wellbeing while fostering meaningful connections with their children.

## Core Principles

### 1. Mother-Baby Connection First

- **Prioritize bonding:** Exercises should enhance, not interfere with, the mother-baby connection.
- **Baby as participant, not equipment:** Never design exercises where the baby is used primarily as a weight or resistance tool.
- **Mindful presence:** Encourage mothers to be present with their babies during exercise, using eye contact, verbal interaction, and responsive engagement.

### 2. Postpartum Recovery Focus

- **Physiological appropriateness:** Design exercises with awareness of the postpartum body's needs and limitations.
- **Progressive recovery:** Structure exercises to accommodate various stages of healing, from immediate postpartum to fully recovered.
- **Functional strength:** Focus on movements that support daily motherhood activities, such as carrying, nursing, and lifting.

### 3. Realistic Accessibility

- **Time-efficient options:** Provide exercises that can be completed in short timeframes (1-10 minutes).
- **Minimal equipment:** Design exercises requiring little to no specialized equipment.
- **Adaptable formats:** Include exercises that can be done while nursing, during baby's nap time, or with baby present and engaged.

## Exercise Design Guidelines

### Exercise Names and Descriptions

- **Avoid objectifying language:** Never use terms like "baby weights" or describe babies as exercise equipment.
- **Use connection-centered language:** Phrases like "with baby," "alongside baby," or "during nursing" emphasize the relationship aspect.
- **Be specific about positioning:** Clearly describe how mother and baby should be positioned for both safety and connection.

### Exercise Categories

Our exercise library should include a balanced mix of:

1. **Recovery Basics:** Fundamental exercises focused on healing and rebuilding core strength
2. **Baby-Inclusive:** Exercises specifically designed with baby participation (not as weight)
3. **Core & Pelvic Floor:** Specialized exercises for postpartum-specific needs
4. **Short Routines:** Quick, efficient exercise sequences for busy days
5. **Flexibility & Mobility:** Gentle movements to restore range of motion
6. **Strength Building:** Progressive exercises to rebuild strength for motherhood demands

### Connection Tips

Every exercise should include specific guidance on maintaining connection with baby:

- **Positioning suggestions:** Where to place baby for optimal interaction
- **Verbal engagement:** What to say or sing to engage baby during movement
- **Visual connection:** How to maintain eye contact during exercise
- **Responsive pausing:** When to pause exercise to respond to baby's needs
- **Modeling mindfulness:** How the mother's focus can benefit the baby's development

### Safety Considerations

- **Clear contraindications:** Identify when exercises are not appropriate (e.g., healing complications)
- **Modification options:** Provide alternatives for various recovery stages and fitness levels
- **Baby safety:** Ensure baby's positioning always prioritizes their safety and comfort
- **Mother's intuition:** Encourage mothers to trust their bodies and their knowledge of their babies

## Examples of Connection-Centered Exercises

### Recommended Approaches:

1. **Gentle Torso Rotations with Baby:**
   - Mother securely holds baby against chest
   - Uses gentle, predictable movements while making eye contact
   - Narrates movement to baby to develop vestibular system and language

2. **Modified Bridges:**
   - Baby positioned safely nearby at eye level
   - Mother maintains eye contact during bridge holds
   - Face-to-face position promotes bonding while strengthening

3. **Standing Baby Cuddle Squats:**
   - Baby held securely against chest
   - Mother sings or counts during movement
   - Creates rhythmic, soothing environment while building leg strength

### Approaches to Avoid:

1. ~~Baby-Weight Shoulder Raises~~ → Instead use: "Gentle Upper Body Stretches with Baby"
   - Focus on holding baby securely for connection, not as resistance
   - Emphasize gentle movements that soothe baby
   - Use as opportunity for face-to-face bonding

2. ~~Using baby for added resistance~~ → Instead: Position baby nearby for eye contact
   - Never suggest adding baby to increase exercise difficulty
   - Remind mothers that baby's safety and comfort comes first
   - Focus on form quality rather than intensity

## Implementation in Content Creation

When developing exercise content:

- Review all exercise names, descriptions, and instructions for objectifying language
- Ensure connection tips are specific, not generic
- Include visual demonstrations of proper positioning for both mother and baby
- Get feedback from postpartum fitness specialists and mothers
- Regularly update content based on new research in maternal health and child development

By following these guidelines, MamaStrength exercises will support our mission of empowering mothers through physical wellbeing while nurturing their connection with their children.
